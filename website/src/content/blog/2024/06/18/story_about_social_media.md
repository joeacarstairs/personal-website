title: A story about the future of social media

  Some time in the not-too-distant future, social media, which is a
  fundamentally fantastic technology which has been royally bollocksed, could
  realise its potential. This is one picture of what that might look like.

There's a lot of pessimism about social media these days. I genuinely believe
that social media is a fundamentally fantastic thing, which has been royally
bollocksed up by gigantic mega-corporations. I've been imagining what a good
future for social media might look like.

In a few years' time, my peers will probably start having children. This could
be the story of one of those children.

Luke is not very technical. The only digital device he owns is a smartphone. He
actively uses social media. He uses it to keep up with friends, to follow
celebrities and to find random funny videos and comic strips.

He uses a couple of authoring apps. He mostly uses _Trik_. It's really popular:
maybe about half his friends use it as their main authoring app. It's really
good for writing short notes and attaching a photo or a video. It has some
photo captioning, filters and video clipping features built-in. But if he wants
to edit photos and videos a bit more, he'll use _Instagram_, and he also uses
_Strava_ because it can use GPS to track his runs and automatically generate
posts with his runtime stats, which he finds really satisfying. If ever he wants
another authoring app, he can find and download it from any app store on the
web. (He uses _Duke_ because it was the name of his dog once. The dog died years
ago, but he still uses _Duke_ because he's never needed to change his habits.)

All his authoring apps use the publishing service which is built-in to his phone
operating system. When he got his phone, he had to go into his settings once
and type in his domain name. Since then, he's never had to worry about it. If
you asked him now, he would not know what the words 'publishing service' mean.
Still, the next time he gets a new phone, he can reasonably expect there to be
some helpful prompting after he's set up his phone to guide him to the right
setting. As a result, whenever he clicks 'Publish' in one of his authoring apps,
the new post automatically gets sent to the server hosting his website code,
which incorporates it into his website, without Luke having to do anything.

That website was set up years ago. It's all static HTML and CSS, managed using a
static CMS, which has a mobile app. Because it's static, it's really affordable:
he pays Â£20 per year to get the domain name plus cloud hosting. A while ago, he
realised the CMS he was using was a bit crap, and switched to the one he's using
now. All he had to do was type in his domain name and enter his admin password,
and the new CMS was set up and ready to go. He can use his domain name as a
single sign-on for pretty much all his online services.

Again, if he wanted, he could go to his phone settings and configure the
built-in publishing service to publish to multiple servers. But everyone can
just read the RSS feed off his website, so there's really not much point.

Then, to get updates from other people, he uses the Facebook feed aggregator.
That pulls in posts from all his friends' websites, as well as the various
content creators, celebrities and media sites he follows.

Facebook is now a semi-obscure corporate blob that does something techy, like
Xerox or Oracle. Luke has no idea that it used to sway governments, capture
regulators and abuse its customers with impunity. Still, one part of the Meta
empire that survived the big anti-trust breakup in 2037 was the feed aggregator,
which is still the world's most popular.

As Luke is on the Free plan, he does get quite a lot of ads. But he knows
that the ads he gets are chosen by contextual information, not behavioural
tracking, because behavioural tracking is super duper illegal. Although he's
not a geek for tech history, 'tracking ads' are a popular byword for corporate
skullduggery, like 'payola' and 'pyramid scheme'. Because regulators have strong
powers and are prepared to use them to protect markets, he trusts that most big
companies are broadly following the rules, even if they are driven by profit.

Facebook does also still have a feed reader on its website. But it clearly
hasn't been maintained in years: it's old, crappy and slow. It even uses an
_infinite scroll_, which is way out of date. It probably dates back to the
days when people were stuck with Facebook's crappy reader because they couldn't
see their friends' posts any other way. Those were the bloody Dark Ages, Luke
thinks. Everyone knows infinite scrolling is junk food for your brain. Who would
choose an infinite scrolling feed given literally any other choice?

Instead, there are loads of free feed readers available on app stores like
_Duke_.  Personally, Luke just uses the Reader tab in _Trik_. Luke likes the
convenience of being able to author posts and view his feed in the same app,
and plus, _Trik_ is really snappy at linking back to the original post. But
he also uses the feed reader that's built in to the _Strava_ app. It only
displays posts that were made in _Strava_, but it's handy because it can make
the elevation graph interactive, and switch out the units according to your
settings. He filters out the _Strava_ posts in _Trik_ so he can read them in
_Strava_ instead.

In between the ads, he gets to read up on what his friends and family are up to
and what they're thinking. In a typical session, he has a quick skim, flicks
through a few photos, and stops to read maybe one or two things that catch his
eye. Then he marks all as 'read' and goes back to whatever he was doing. He
likes that he can use those spare moments, on the bus, between meetings at work,
and, OK, yes, on the loo, to get a quick update on what people are up to. He
feels he can stay in the loop better, and when he meets people face to face, he
comes pre-prepped with a conversation starter or two.

Occasionally, a post will generate a bit more engagement than just a re-post or
a reaction, and there'll be a bit of discussion. Sometimes, online discussions
do get out of hand, but on the whole, the temperature stays manageable, because
most people don't configure their feed readers to receive replies from people
they don't know.

Unfortunately, even so, Luke has once or twice got some really unwelcome
posts. He had to block the authors, which means his feed aggregator filters out
everything they post. You can't change the fact that there will always be some
mean people out there. But at least you don't have to see them in your feed.

He does also follow some people he doesn't know. He gets some sketch comedy,
some hiking videos, some celebrity feeds, a couple of podcasts and news updates
from the BBC. If he ever wants to find something new, he switches over to the
Recommended tab on his feed reader. Some of what's there is plain junk, but some
of it is genuinely quite good. Plus, he gets some old-fashioned recommendations
straight from the people he follows. If they post a link to a feed, he can click
on the link, and his feed reader will automatically configure his Facebook to
start aggregating posts from that feed.
